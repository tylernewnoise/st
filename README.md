### st - simple terminal
[st]( https://st.suckless.org/) is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks
less.

The PKBUILD includes the scrollback and the blinking cursor patches. Inspired
by [this blogpost](https://brianbuccola.com/how-to-build-and-install-st-suckless-simple-terminal-from-source-on-arch-linux/).

config.h with custom color scheme (gruvbox) and scrollback for the mouse.
